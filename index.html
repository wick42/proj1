			<li><h3>What did you learn today?</h3></li>
			<p>Today was about relearning, or remembering. A few new things learned were some online resources, and a bit of git knowlwdge.</p>
			<li><h3>What was challenging?</h3></li>
			<p>Everything was somewhat familiar today, but I'm sure many challenges await.</p>
			<li><h3>What will I do tomorrow?</h3></li>
			<p>More reading, some Treehouse and coding these answers.</p>

			<li><h3>What was challenging?</h3></li>
			<p>Finding the time to study and read. I wasn't aware of how short my chunks of free time are during the day, even though I've been doing this homemaker job for a long time. Whenever I sat down to work, something would interrupt me within 15 minutes. Looks like I'll be doing most of this late at night.</p>
			<li><h3>What will I do tomorrow?</h3></li>
			<p>More reading, and more Treehouse.</p>
